 Introduction
==============

PyOpenGLng, proudly blessed as is, is an experimental OpenGL wrapper for |Python| which generate the
requested OpenGL API from the `OpenGL XML Registry
<https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/ogl/trunk/doc/registry/public/api>`_ and use an automatic
translator to map the C API to Python. Actually the wrapper use ctypes.

By design this wrapper supports all the OpenGL version, but it focus towards the programmable
pipeline and the most recent API. On Linux desktop Mesa release 10 supports OpenGL 3.3.

The Python package provides three components:

* an Oriented Object API to the OpenGL XML registry,
* a ctypes wrapper,
* and an experimental high level API.
