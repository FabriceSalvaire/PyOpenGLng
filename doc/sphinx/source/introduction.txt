 Introduction
==============

PyOpenGLng, proudly blessed as is, is an experimental |OpenGL|_ wrapper for |Python|_ which generate
the requested OpenGL API from the |OpenGL_XML_Registry|_ and use an automatic translator to map the
C API to Python. Actually the wrapper use ctypes.

By design this wrapper supports all the OpenGL version, but it focus towards the programmable
pipeline and the most recent API. On Linux desktop Mesa release 10 supports OpenGL 3.3.

The Python package provides three components:

* an Oriented Object API to the OpenGL XML registry,
* a ctypes wrapper,
* and an experimental high level API.
